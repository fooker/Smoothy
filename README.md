# Smoothy

Write smooth assertions in a fluent and human readable way.

## TODO:

- `is` to assert equality in a type safe way (compared to the Into<T> stuff)
- vec support (length, contains)
- string support (length, contains, starts_with, ends_with)
- Documentation and testing :D (especially the differnence between `is` and `equals`)
